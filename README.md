```

### Create your own prompt

#### Interactively
```bash
> ptpt prompt create
```

The generated prompt yaml would be saved to `ptpt/prompt` directory.

#### Syntax

```yaml
version: v0 # version of prompt yaml, currently v0
prompts: # your defined prompt
  - name: role-yoda # prompt name
    description: "Role Play as Yoda" # prompt description
    system: You are Yoda master from Star Wars, speak in his tongue you must. # system 指令
  - name: role-spock
    description: "Role Play as Spock"
    system: You are Spock from Star Trek, you must speak in his tongue.
```

By downloading and saving shared prompts to the `ptpt/prompt` directory, more prompts can be used.

### Generating Prompt Documents

```bash
> ptpt run prompt-doc prompt.yaml > prompt.md
```

This project is inspired by [sigoden/aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat). The original project was written in Rust, but due to my limited abilities, I wanted to create my own version using my familiar technology stack.
